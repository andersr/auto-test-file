## Getting Started

### Installing

- `npm install auto-test-file`
- This will provide access to the `atf` command which can be used to start the file watcher.

### Running the watcher

- Add a watcher script to your `package.json` file, eg `"atf": "atf -d 'src' -e 'ts' 'tsx'"`
- Run the script, which will launch the watcher.
- Files will be auto-generated while the script is running.
- Index files and dot files are ignored.

### Config Options

`--directory`/ `-d`: name of directory to be watched eg `'src'`.

`--extensions` / `-e`: extensions for which to create test files eg `'js'` `'jsx'`.

`--noSpecInput`: do not ask for specs on add of a file.
